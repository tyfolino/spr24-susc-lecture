# Basics of version control

1) Add file(s) to a staging area.
`git add myfile.py`
2) Write changes to a local repository.
`git commit -m "made some changes"`
3) (Opt.) Push changes to *remote* repository.
`git push -u origin main`

Note: while it's good to know these commands, we will use a GUI to make it easier.
